# Wuhan 2020 Website

### Background
This repository aims to, to a large extent, replicate the Chinese website [Wuhan 2020](https://wuhan2020.kaiyuanshe.cn/) 
by the official [wuhan2020](https://github.com/wuhan2020) Github organisation. As the website is in Mandarin, it's 
catered to mostly, if not all, Chinese. Hence, we believe that our website can become the platform for the 
international market to contribute to the Wuhan crisis in China.

For now, our top priority feature is the <span style="text-decoration: underline">goods</span> **donation** feature,
not <span style="text-decoration: underline">money</span>.
